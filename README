Endless
=======
A tiny webapp for generating an endless stream of data in an HTTP response.


Installation
============

  gem install endless


Usage
=====

  rake server[5678]

  curl -s http://localhost:5678/endless | head -c 100

Caveats
=======

Pre-alpha software. Useful for testing purposes only.

Currently, I think the server just keeps streaming a response even after the
client disconnects, until you kill the server. Pull requests welcome!
